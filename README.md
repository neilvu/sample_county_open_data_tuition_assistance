# Montgomery County (Maryland) Tuition Assistance Program Data Analysis - Open Data

Open Data can be found in this link - https://data.montgomerycountymd.gov/Education/Tuition-Assistance/p7z5-tjrz/about_data.

Using MySQL Workbench, we want to analyze based on the progress report for the county's tuition assistance program for county employees. We assess based on the attendance for the applicants' institution, to courses that they signed up and the cost for each of them listed. We want to see if they are correlated to their current job duties in their careers or for their personal pursuits. While this data only showed a limited amount of details due to its sensitivity of protected individuals, we would like to investigate deeper in their progress if applicant were likely to succeed in the course as well the career outcomes as already outlined in this script. I look forward to see how this plays out on my personal project.
